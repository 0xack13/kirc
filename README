kirc

KISS for IRC, an IRC client written in POSIX C99.


BACKGROUND
----------

After having tried multiple IRC clients, I decided to develope my own. The 
result is a portable application that has no dependencies other than a C99 
compiler.


OBJECTIVES
----------

- Per the UNIX philosophy, "Do one thing and do it well" [3].
- True to the KISS principle [4], the code-base is intentionally smaller 
  than most IRC clients (<250 sloc). The benefits of a small code base
  reflects in the ability for kirc to be reviewed, understood and 
  maintained by a single person. Therefore, all feature requests and 
  commits shall be considered with respect to the readability and 
  maintainance of the overall project. 
- Let's not "reinvent the wheel". Commands and functionality should
  feel familiar (e.g. vi command shortcuts) and accessable via a  
  standard 104-key US QWERTY keyboard layout [5].  Where possible, the 
  number of keystrokes shall be minimized per command.


FEATURES
--------

- automatic host PING response.
- vi-like shortcuts:

  <message>                   send a message to the current channel
  /m <nick|channel> <message> send a message to a specified nick or channel
  /n <message>                send a message to NickServ
  /j <channel>                join a specified channel
  /p <channel>                leave (part) a specified channel
  /Q <message>                send a message and close the host connection
  /q                          close the host connection

- automatic word wrapping using the greedy algorithm.
- color scheme definition via ANSI 8-bit colors [1]. Therefore, one could
  theoretically achieve uniform color definition across all shell applications
  and tools.
